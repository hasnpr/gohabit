# Decision Records (DRs)

This directory contains architectural decision records for the GoHabit project. Each decision document captures the context, options considered, and rationale behind significant technical choices made during development.

## Purpose

These decision records serve to:
- **Document rationale** - Capture why specific architectural choices were made
- **Share knowledge** - Help team members understand design decisions
- **Track evolution** - Maintain a history of how the architecture evolved
- **Enable reviews** - Provide context for code reviews and future changes
- **Onboard developers** - Help new team members understand the codebase quickly

## Review Process

All architectural decisions documented here have been reviewed by:
- **Claude AI** - For technical best practices and Go idioms
- **CodeRabbit** - For code quality and maintainability analysis
